              I have been in the Health and Fitness industry since 2017. Formerly a Division 1 Lacrosse Athlete, I took an interest in the Health and Fitness industry. I found fulfillment from improving peopleâ€™s lives through fitness.
              Throughout this time, I have delivered life-changing results to clients. I put my training methods to the test as a Competitive Bodybuilder to the test.
