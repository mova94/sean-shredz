        My goal is to empower my clients, and inspire them to test their true capabilities.
        Before I became a trainer, I was a dedicated athlete. I played Division 1 College Lacrosse, and I had numerous coaches throughout my athletic career. These coaches contributed tremendously to my success as an athlete. I was trained in everything including agility work, skills training, and strength training. I owe much of my success to these coaches, as they helped me to become the athlete and trainer I am today.
        My training style is different from most. With my extensive background in athletic training, Iâ€™m able to help my clients look good, and FEEL good. Joining my training program will be your first step towards a better, easier life.
